# WordCloud
Word cloud project for my CS class. No compiled releases because I'm not implementing a text editor into this.
It's CLI only. Open it in your favorite java IDE, place files in appropriate locations, and have fun. Edit them too. It can handle empty text, I made sure of that.

If it breaks fix it yourself.

No, it doesn't actually have part of the gta6 source code.
